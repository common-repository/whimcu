Customer and product woocommerce analytics designed to maximize sales. Simply the best Google Analytics plugin for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Are you a business owner who excels at creating your products but struggles to understand the data needed to support the growth of your business? 
Google Analytics and other analytics apps can feel overwhelming if you don’t understand the tech jargon. 
With [Whimcu - WooCommerce Customer and Product Analytics](http://whosmycustomer.com/), we’re offering a fully developed, easy-to-use, easy-to-understand WooCommerce analytics app designed specifically for WordPress & WooCommerce that will leave you feeling confident in your ability to break down and analyze your own analytics. 
With a glance at our dashboard, you’ll know which social channels your customers are visiting from, how they are spending their time and money, which products are climbing the bestseller list, and what you need to do to hit your financial goals.

How are you supposed to grow your business if you can’t dive deeply into customer behavior and conversions?

With Whimcu - WooCommerce Customer and Product Analytics, you can. And for free! No more guessing if your marketing strategy is working. 
When you know the source and behavior of your customers, you can better plan your ad spend on social media marketing and other forms of advertising.

== How it works ==

When you download the app, it will read your store data (Don’t worry, your data is secure!). 
From there, you’ll land on a beautiful dashboard that allows you to see how things are going at a glance. 
We like charts and graphs here at Whimcu, and we hope you do too!

== Deep Dive Into Your WooCommerce Analytics ==
Right now, you’ll find the pages below as a launch point into your business. 
We have several other pages in the works that will include Buyer Profile, Visitor Profile, and Channel Details. 
The deep-dive pages you’ll find when you download Whimcu today include:

= The Main Dashboard =
A quick glance at all of your information. 
You can see which social channels shoppers are visiting from, your top 5 products, the total visitors, buyers, and sales over a set period of time.

= Sales Overview Page =
Learn about your buyers’ and visitors’ shopping behaviors, which social media channels they’re visiting from, and what they’re purchasing. 
You’ll find the total sales here with the option to specify specific dates.

= Product Analysis Page =
Get into the nitty-gritty details about each of your products. 
You’ll quickly ascertain which products are doing well and which need a little attention. 
On the product analysis page, you’ll be able to see how many customers added products to their cart, how many reached checkout, how many made it to the payments page, and then, finally, how many bought the product. 
This journey through the conversion funnel provides useful information about where you need to focus your attention to maximize your profits.
